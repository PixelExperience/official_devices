# Pixel Experience
## Official devices application

Devices repository: https://github.com/PixelExperience-Devices

Before open a pull request to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few simple things:

### 1. Hosting

Our files are hosted on [Android File Host](http://androidfilehost.com/), this means you must have a developer account to host the builds of your device.

The folder must be in **hidden mode**, so our [download portal](https://download.pixelexperience.org/) can manage statistics correctly.

### 2. Changelog
For each new version, you need to upload the changelog to this repository in the device specific folder.

The changelog file name must match the **.zip** file name and should end with **.txt**
Eg: **.zip** is **PixelExperience_potter-8.1.0-20180207-0418-OFFICIAL.zip**, changelog file name should be **PixelExperience_potter-8.1.0-20180207-0418-OFFICIAL.txt**

### 3. Over-the-air (OTA) updates
Our system is automatic, you should not worry about updating some script, just upload the new build to the Android File Host device folder and send a pull request with the changelog in this repository.

**Note:** New builds can take up to 30 minutes to appear on the site and in the OTA application.
