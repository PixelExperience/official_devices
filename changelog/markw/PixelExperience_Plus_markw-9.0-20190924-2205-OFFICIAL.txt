- Volte and Wifi calls was fixed and now should work
- Props realisation was reworked in Device Tree
- Device settings (torch, vibro) was removed due to rules (that was added accidentally in previous build)
- Kernel was updated to Illuminated 3.18.140 by me, based on Franco by @franciscofranco with some goodies from Nosgoth by @Razziell and some changes by me.
- Kernel have same overclocked frequencies as Nosgoth
- Some other clean-ups and optimizations
