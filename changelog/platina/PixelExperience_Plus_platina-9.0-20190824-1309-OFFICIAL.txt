Just clarifing some things:

On Plus version

* White notifications when using dark theme is not a bug, we removed themed notifications because the current implementation has various issues on some apps, also the code on framework has a lot of dirty code. This function will return only on Android Q.

On Normal version

* The dark theme is not applied system wide, it's applied only to statusbar QS, this is the default behavior on Pie stock version of Pixel.
