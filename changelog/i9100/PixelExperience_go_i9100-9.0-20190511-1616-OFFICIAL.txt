- KNOWN ISSUES
* Root mode does not work due to the use of Magisk in current devices. When trying to use the SuperSU application, it causes bootloop. The solution for SuperSU to work will take some time to implement. DO NOT ASK ME WHEN.
* Slow start due to GAPPS. Wait 5 minutes before setting up the appliance.
* Initial wallpaper with different colors on the first start. Apply again and return to normal.
